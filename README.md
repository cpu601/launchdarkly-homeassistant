# Release light ðŸ’¡ with LaunchDarkly and Home Assistant

Inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n0weDGWTy8) LaunchDarkly introduction video to feature flags I decided to build an actual light switch controlled via LaunchDarkly feature flags.

The Python script presented evaluates a [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) feature flag called `HomeAssistantLight` and uses the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) home automation API to control a smart light switch based on the targeting status of the feature flag.

### Do I need Home Assistant?

To use the `HomeAssistantLight.py` script, a running Home Assistant instance with at least one `"light"` entity is reqiured! The script controls the `"light.launchdarkly"` entity by default.

If one does not own a Home Assistant home automation instance, a stripped down version of the script (`NoHomeAssistant.py`) is available which will simply give a visual representation of the light switch status as a console output.

### Required environment variables

The Python script reads the folllowing environment variables:
- `HA_API_KEY` - The API key to interact with the Home Assistant API (not required for stripped down version of the script)
- `HA_IP` - The IP address of the Home Assistant instance (not required for stripped down version of the script)
- `LAUNCHDARKLY_KEY` - The LaunchDarkly SDK Key (always required)

### Required LaunchDarkly feature flags

The Python script evaluates the targeting status of a LaunchDarkly feature flag called `HomeAssistantLight`.
